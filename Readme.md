<h2>Project Description</h2>

We can identify the service or product that the company sell through their trademark logo. The trademark logo may be designed with a combination of icon, word, image, symbol or colour.

Thus, the project's purpose is to create a unique trademark logo which to avoid the problems with misidentification and plagiarism of trademarks. Therefore, we are able to design your own company trademark logo by typing your company name, adjusting the customize options and then selecting the desired font style on your own.

<h3>Risk Identification Chart</h3>

Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it?
---|---|---|---
Quality|The result is very subjective. As the classification of data is done manually. Not all people can agree with the result.| The system generates an unexpected logo during testing.| Do survey about the style and update the dataset. 
Cost| Choosing the wrong laptop or server spec and may lead to buy another laptop again.|During implementation, if our laptop cannot support the system, then it means we bought an unsuitable laptop.|Do more research about the suitable laptop or server spec for training a model.
Time|Not enough time to implement a more mature system. This is because of time consuming in training the model. | If we can’t get a model in the scheduled time during implementation|Use pretrained model instead of train from scratch
